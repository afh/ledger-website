# About the site

The ledger-cli.org site is kept in the
[ledger-website](https://github.com/ledger/ledger-website) repo ([changes](https://github.com/ledger/ledger-website/commits/master)).
It is static html generated from markdown by [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll).
Commits will normally appear on ledger-cli.org immediately, otherwise on the hour.

Version-specific documentation, with urls beginning `/3.0/` or
`/2.6/`, comes from the ledger docs in the
[`master`](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/tree/master) and
[`maint`](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/tree/maint) branches
respectively.

There is also a wiki, that of the ledger repo on Github, with a convenient
url alias: [wiki.ledger-cli.org](http://wiki.ledger-cli.org).

The site is built using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ledger/ledger-website) and deploys to an Amazon S3 bucket
which is then served up with an Amazon CloudFront distribution.

The current webmaster is <a href="mailto:pete@petekeen.net">Pete Keen</a>. All help is welcome.
